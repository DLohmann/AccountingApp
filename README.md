#Numerical-Analysis-Methods


In the MATLAB file, the code was written for the class Math 131: Numerical Methods at UC Merced during the Spring 2017. Special thanks to Professor Vu Thai Luan, who taught the class, and to Shagun Rawat, who helped inspire the writer to complete this code.


This code will be complete when it can perform curve fitting and linear regression using:
-hill climbing
-gradient descent
-genetic algorithm
-neural network

as well as

-approximate a solution to a differential equation using an exponentially weighted moving average, the derivative at multiple points and the approximation at multiple steps (multistep numerical method)
-Find a maximum or minimum of a function by finding 3 or more points on (or the entire) level curve of a function, and finding the average (centroid) of theses points. This will me another max or min finding numerical method.
